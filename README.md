    - [ ] Gotcha: you need pointer to pointer knowledge:
        (for when you pass a pointer to a function that may change the address where that pointer points)
        This page is just to get a grasp on ptr to ptr. I don't recommend this list traversal style. Readability and maintainability suffer due to cleverness.

    - [x] [Circular buffer/FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
    - [ ] Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:
        - enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
        - empty()

    - [ ] Implement with array using linear probing
        - hash(k, m) - m is size of hash table
        - add(key, value) - if key already exists, update value
        - exists(key)
        - get(key)
        - remove(key)
